           This project illustrates the integration of Generic Artificial Intelligence principles with the creation of a real-time video captioning and audio narration system. The central goal is to mimic a human-like knowledge of visual information by combining multiple AI fieldsâ€”specifically computer vision, natural language processing, and speech synthesis. It captures real-time video from a webcam, produces semantically meaningful text descriptions with the ViT-GPT2 vision-language model, and synthesizes these captions back into natural audio using an offline text-to-speech system (pyttsx3). It is a multi-modal pipeline exhibiting a move in the direction of generalized AI activity by allowing computers to sense, reason, and speak about what they are perceiving in real time.
               Central to the system is a pretrained Vision Transformer with GPT2, which serves as the captioning generative backbone. With this architecture, the system can identify important objects in every frame and narrate them naturally in English. The captions are dynamically wrapped and rendered over the video stream, and the associated audio plays back in real time. Optimizations like frame skipping and image resampling keep the system running smoothly without compromising accuracy. The platform is completely offline-capable, so it can work in areas of low connectivity or privacy restrictions.
                  Other applicability such as the applicability of visually impaired accessibility, the project emphasizes the general applicability of vision-language AI models across areas such as smart surveillance, educational applications, content generation, and interactive robots. It also demonstrates how Generic AI can provide a connection between sensory input and natural language and generate context-sensitive responses. Its effective operation and utilization verify the applicability and functionality of applying AI models to practical, real-time uses, constituting a proving ground for yet more generalized autonomous systems.
